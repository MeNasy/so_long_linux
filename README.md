# So_long

So_long is a project from 42 school that introduces us to the development of 2D games and graphical interfaces using the C programming language. The objective of the game is to collect all the coins on a map and reach the exit door.

## Installation

Clone the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:MeNasy/so_long_linux.git so_long_linux

```

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
sudo apt install libx11-dev libxext-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev libxpm-dev libxmu-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxt-dev libbsd-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libtiff-dev libgif-dev libopenexr-dev libmpc-dev libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev libgomp1 libgomp-plugin-nvptx libgomp1-plugin-nvptx libatomic1 libquadmath0 libpgm-dev libssl-dev
```

If thereâ€™s a missing library or tool, the system will notify you in the error message when you run the code. You can install the specified tool or library using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install package_name
```

## Usage

Navigate to the cloned project:

```bash
cd so_long_linux
```

If libft.a or libmlx.a are not created, perform these steps:

To create the libft.a file, navigate to the libft folder and run the make command:

```bash
cd libft
make
cd ..
```

To create the libmlx.a file, navigate to the mlx folder and run the make command:

```bash
cd mlx
make
cd ..
```

To compile the program, run the following command in the so_long_linux directory:

```bash
gcc *.c gnl/get_next_line.c libft/libft.a -Lmlx -lmlx_Linux -lX11 -lXext -lm -lz
```

After running the code, a.out will be created. Then run one of the following commands:

```bash
./a.out maps/map.ber
```

or

```bash
./a.out maps/mini.ber
```

After completing these steps, the game screen will open.

## Gameplay

To win the game, you need to collect all the coins and reach the exit door. Good luck! ðŸ˜Š

You can use the W, A, S, D keys to move the player and the ESC key to close the program.

If you canâ€™t move the player or close the program with the ESC key, terminate the program and follow these steps:

Your computerâ€™s behavior may differ on Linux. If the player does not move when you press the W, A, S, D keys after running the program, or if the program does not close with the ESC key, your key values are different from the values in the code. In this case:

- Find the ft_key_handler function in so_long_linux/map_create.c.
- Add a printf structure to the ft_key_handler() function to see your own keyboard codes. Write `printf("%d\n",key_code);`.
- Run the program. When the game window opens, press the W, A, S, D and ESC keys. The values corresponding to these keys will appear in your terminal. Note these values.
- Write the values you noted in the appropriate places of the if conditions. For example, add the value corresponding to the A key to the condition that the ft_go_left() function will work.
- After adding the values for each key, the program will be ready to run. After this step, repeat the steps in the compilation part to run the program:

```bash
gcc *.c gnl/get_next_line.c libft/libft.a -Lmlx -lmlx_Linux -lX11 -lXext -lm -lz
./a.out maps/map.ber
```

## Customization

You can also customize the program. You can display your own images on the screen and play the game that way. To do this:

- Find 5 images: player, floor, wall, and collectible items.
- Adjust the size of the photos to 64x64. You can use https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image
- Convert the images you have adjusted to .xpm file. You can use https://convertio.co/tr/jpg-xpm/
- Name your .xpm files like the files in the so_long_linux/textures directory: player, wall, coin, and empty. The program will not work if the names are not the same.
- After the naming process, remove the files in the textures folder and place your own .xpm files.
- After running the code, the images you uploaded will be on the screen.
